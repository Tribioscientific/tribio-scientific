            Nitrosamines are chemical compounds classified as probable human carcinogens on the basis of animal studies. EU regulators first became aware of nitrosamines in medicines in mid-2018 when nitrosamine impurities, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), were detected in blood pressure medicines known as 'sartans'. There is a very low risk that nitrosamine impurities at the levels found in medicines could cause cancer in humans.

    <li>
    FDA has been investigating the presence of impurities, called nitrosamines, in some types of medications.
    </li>
    <li>
    Nitrosamines are common in water and foods, including cured and grilled meats, dairy products and vegetables. Everyone is exposed to some level of nitrosamines.
    </li>
    <li>
  	FDA, in collaboration with regulatory counterparts around the world, has set internationally-recognized acceptable daily intake limits for nitrosamines. If drugs contain levels of nitrosamines above the acceptable daily intake limits, FDA recommends these drugs be recalled by the manufacturer as appropriate. </li>
    <li>
    Nitrosamine impurities may increase the risk of cancer if people are exposed to them above acceptable levels and over long periods of time, but a person taking a drug that contains nitrosamines at-or-below the acceptable daily intake limits every day for 70 years is not expected to have an increased risk of cancer.
    </li> 
    <li>
    Patients taking prescription medications with potential nitrosamine impurities should not stop taking their medications. Patients should talk to their health care professionals about concerns and other treatment options.
    </li> 
    <li>
    Consumers taking over-the-counter medications with potential nitrosamine impurities may consider using other OTC products approved for their condition.
    </li> 
    <li>
    Find information about medications that have been recalled due to potential nitrosamine impurities on the FDA recalls webpage.
    </li> 
    <li>
    The agency is working to determine the source of these impurities and will keep the public informed.
    </li>
